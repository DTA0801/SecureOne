# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This folder captures **why** key decisions were made, so future contributors don't have to re-litigate them. Each ADR is short and immutable once accepted; superseded decisions get a new ADR that references the old one.

## Format
Each ADR: Context → Decision → Consequences → Status.
