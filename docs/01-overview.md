# 01 — Overview

## Vision

SecureOne is a **centralized Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform**. Independent applications delegate their authentication and authorization to SecureOne instead of each building their own login, user store, and permission system. It plays the same role as Keycloak, Auth0, or Okta, but is self-hostable and owned end to end.

One central system provides:

- **Authentication** — verifying who a user (or machine) is.
- **Authorization** — deciding what that identity is allowed to do.
- **User management** — lifecycle of accounts across many applications and tenants.
- **Federation & integration** — standards-based APIs so any app can plug in.

## Goals

1. **Single source of truth for identity** across many applications.
2. **Standards-first** — OAuth 2.1, OIDC, SAML 2.0, SCIM — so existing client libraries "just work."
3. **Multi-tenant by design** — one deployment serves many organizations with strict isolation.
4. **Secure by default** — strong hashing, encryption of secrets, short-lived tokens, auditability.
5. **Operable & portable** — runs on PostgreSQL, deployable from a single VM up to Kubernetes; data layer abstracted so other engines can be added later.
6. **Developer-friendly** — clean admin UI, OpenAPI, SDKs, and documentation.

## Non-goals (initially)

- Being a general-purpose CRM or user-profile product.
- Supporting arbitrary/NoSQL database engines (relational only — see [Database Strategy](06-database.md)).
- Hand-rolling the OAuth/OIDC protocol (we build **on top of** Spring Authorization Server, a certified engine).

## Key concepts & glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Tenant** | An organization/customer boundary. All tenant data is isolated. |
| **Application** | A registered app within a tenant (e.g. "Billing", "Mobile App"). Roles/permissions are scoped under applications. |
| **OAuth client** | The credentials/config an application uses to obtain tokens. |
| **User** | A human identity within a tenant. |
| **Admin** | A user who manages a tenant (`type = ADMIN`). |
| **Super-admin / Platform admin** | A platform operator who manages *all* tenants. Kept in a separate trust tier. |
| **Service account** | A non-human identity for machine-to-machine access; authenticates via API keys / client credentials. |
| **Role** | A named bundle of permissions, scoped to an application. |
| **Permission** | An atomic capability declared by an application (e.g. `invoice:read`). |
| **Session** | A server-side login session (backs SSO and the hosted login UI). |

## Core features (definitions)

- **Multi-application support** — many apps share one identity system; each app defines its own roles/permissions and OAuth client config.
- **User / admin / super-admin management** — full lifecycle (create, disable, lock, delete), with three distinct trust tiers.
- **Application-specific roles & permissions** — RBAC scoped per application, so the same role name can differ between apps.
- **Tenant / organization support** — multi-tenancy with app-layer isolation (see [Architecture](03-architecture.md)).
- **OAuth2 & OIDC** — Authorization Code + PKCE, Client Credentials, refresh-token rotation, discovery, JWKS.
- **JWT access + refresh tokens** — short-lived signed JWTs; refresh tokens server-side and revocable.
- **Optional SAML & identity brokering** — enterprise SSO + federation from external IdPs / LDAP / AD (Phase 3).
- **MFA/2FA — passkeys-first** — phishing-resistant WebAuthn/FIDO2 (incl. passwordless), with TOTP, **SMS OTP**, **email OTP**, and push fallbacks; recovery codes; per-tenant MFA policy, AAL levels, and step-up.
- **Password reset & email verification** — single-use, short-lived, hashed tokens.
- **Audit logs & login history** — append-only audit trail + per-user login outcomes.
- **API keys / service accounts** — M2M access mapped onto the same RBAC engine.
- **Admin dashboard & self-service portal** — manage tenants, apps, users, roles, clients, sessions, audit; end-user self-service for security/MFA/sessions.
- **Developer docs & SDKs** — OpenAPI spec, a docs portal, and a TypeScript SDK (more in later phases). See [Authentication UI integration](13-auth-ui-integration.md) for hosted vs custom end-user login.
- **Flexible database setup** — PostgreSQL connection configured at install; the data layer is abstracted (repository interfaces) so other engines can be added later.

> Beyond the core above, SecureOne has a full **enterprise capability roadmap** (governance/IGA, fine-grained authorization, adaptive auth, compliance, multi-region scale). See [Enterprise Capabilities](10-enterprise.md).

## Primary user personas

1. **Platform operator (super-admin)** — runs the SecureOne deployment, manages tenants.
2. **Tenant admin** — manages users, apps, roles within their organization.
3. **End user** — logs into one of the integrated applications.
4. **Developer/integrator** — wires an application into SecureOne using OIDC + the SDK.
5. **Service/machine** — calls APIs using a service account + API key.
